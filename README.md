# sqlvms-azure

This repo is (yet another) playground of mine, where I'm intending to experiment with a combination of interesting devops tools
- Terraform for infrastructure
- Azure Automation w/ DSC for configuration management.

I'm picking on SQL as the thing to deploy, in reality, you'd have to have a good reason not to use a PaaS version of SQL on Azure, 
but it's an interesting workload and has a mature DSC resource to play with
